### What is this repo?

Used for showing off different Django concepts.

### When was it used?

This was demonstrated at some talks I gave at the [Mobile App Development Lab](http://mobile.utoronto.ca/madlab) at the University of Toronto. Also a condensed version was given at [The Centre For Business and Innovation in Computer Science](http://www.dcsil.ca/) on the second floor of the Gerstein Library at the University of Toronto.
